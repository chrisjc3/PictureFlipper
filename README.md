# PictureFlipper
I wanted something that I could point at a directory and sort through pictures. 

Doesn't seem to work with large directories and pyinstaller. Works straight from script. Probably something to do with memory that's out of my depth.

I'm sure half the imports aren't necessary either. I mostly copy/paste my frequently used ones.
